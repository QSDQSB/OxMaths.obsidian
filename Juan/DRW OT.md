Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables with $E(Y)=6, \operatorname{Var}(Y)=$ $3, E(X)=4, \operatorname{Var}(X)=5$, and $\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)=0$.
Suppose we do a linear regression of $X$ on $Y$, which gives us the resulting linear model $Y=a+b \times X$.
What is the value of $a+b$ ?

$a$ should be $6$ and $b$ should be $0$. This is because the variance of $Y$ is much smaller than the variance of $X$, and therefore a straight line parallel to $x$-axis would give the least error.

Blake flips a fair coin and stops flipping once he gets a head. $\mathrm{He}$ gets the minimum of $\$ 16$ and $\$ 2^n$, where $n$ is the total number of Blake's flips. For example, if Blake flips a head on the first try, then $n=1$.
What is the fair value of this game?

A machine produces a weighted coin that lands on heads with an unknown probability $p$, and we know that $P(p \leq x)=x^3$.
You flip the coin 4 times, and every time it lands on heads.
What is the probability that the next flip will also land on heads?
(Enter your answer as a decimal).

You have a coin which comes heads with probability $1 / 4$, and you toss it 500 times. If there are multiple coins in a row (could be just 1), we call them/it a streak. For example, if we get HTHTT, we have 4 streaks: first $H$, second $T$, third $H$, and last two $T$.
What is the expected number of streaks in 500 tosses?
