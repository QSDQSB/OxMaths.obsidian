## Unique Strength
My key strength is the passion to learn.

This actually breaks down to two parts.

1.  The first part is the curiosity to learn new things.
    1.  In this industry, you know, we need to keep a weather eye on everything happening in the world - cuz in one sense or another, anything happened would finally be reflected on the market.
        -   In my years at Oxford, I always enjoy talking to people with different backgrounds and majors, getting a glimpse of what is currently going on in the world in which they study. <Agricultural> I like to keep myself on track, gathering all kinds of information.
        -   I would also like to see how the latest news and technology can help me promote myself. Take my own learning experience as an example. I used to take paper notes. #TODO
2.  The second part is the persistent of getting to the bottom of one thing, the drive to understand the whole principle and mechanism behind a certain event, theorem or tech. I would like to emphasise my experience with cryptocurrency. Crytocurrency actually got my attention last April when Elon Musk was calling out for dogecoin on twitter. Out of the curiosity to understand the technology behind bitcoin, I studied ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography), understanded what makes the encryption of Bitcoin, the elliptic curve y^2=x^3+7, so special. Knowing the pros and cons of blockchain and encryption algorithm further widen my insight in crypto and this better clears my judgement.

So in conclusion, i believe my curiosity and persistence to learn things enables me to make a comprehensive and clear judgement, and this makes me suitable for the position.



## Why Quant

1.  Competitive nature.
    
    Quant trading is an every day changing industry. It's not like a normal IT job, where we usually have a long-term project and carry on some daily routines. We don't know when a black swan event occurs. So timing is essential and it requires immediate response. However, whenever risks emerge, opportunities follow as well. I am just passionate about the idea of turning a risk into something profitable, holding the same information as anyone else, but noticing the unnoticable details, act beforehand, and win. I really enjoy these fast-pace challenge-facing life. I like playing these kinds of games - not only attempting to grasp every opportunity to profit, but also considering the whole picture, doing risk control - win with certainty, confidence and ease. This sense of achievement gives me every day passion to devote myself to this field.
    
2.  For me, quant trading and perhaps,quant research in the future, is an ideal way to apply my maths and stats knowledge in the real world. During my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to improving my rigorousness during logic deduction, improving my creativity in problem solving, not to mention the math intuition. And I hope these skill sets of mine will be useful to your company and to this role.
