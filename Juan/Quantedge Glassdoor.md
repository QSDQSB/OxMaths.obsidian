1. Can you explain the significance in linear regression?
2. Suppose you have 100 predictors on the price of a product. After running 100 univariate regressions, you found five significant predictors (type I less than 5%). Would you use these to make your trade decisions? Why or why not? Assuming all the predictors are not correlated in any way, how is it different from the multivariate model with 100 predictors? What is the number of significant predictors you will get in this model? Is it five?
3. What is the expected value of the square of a single dice in one roll. How is it compared than the previous one? Why? And if all dices are biased in the same way? Is the conclusion still the same?
