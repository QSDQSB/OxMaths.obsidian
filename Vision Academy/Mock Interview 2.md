# Mock Interview 2
1. Find the greatest integer $k$ such that $k^2$ is a factor of $10!$.
2. Peter has 25 cards, each printed with a different integer from 1 to 25. He wishes to place N cards in a single row so that the numbers on every adjacent pair of cards have a prime factor in common. What is the largest value of N for which this is possible?
3. Pick three students from a class of ten to participate in a contest, and at least one of student A and student B must join. How many ways in total?
4. 2,000 students stand in a line. One by one they start counting off from left to right: the first counts 1, the second counts 2, the third counts 1, the fourth counts 2,..., the 1,999th counts 1, and the 2,000th counts 2. Then the students who counts 1 leaves the queue. We repeat this procedure until only 1 person stays in the queue.
5. Does the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=4531$ have any integer solutions?
