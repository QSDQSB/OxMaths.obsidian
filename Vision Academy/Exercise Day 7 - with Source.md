## Primes
### 1
Prove that $n^{4}+4^{n}$ is not a prime for any integer $\mathrm{n}>1$.
### 2 (TBO56)
Prove that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4 n+3$.
### 3
Prove that there is no prime term among the sequence $10001,100010001,1000100010001, \ldots$

## Exact Division & Congruence
### 4
Prove that $10 \ldots 01(199$ "0"s) is divisible by $101 .$
### 5 (TBO45)
Prove that $n^{2}\left(n^{2}-1\right)\left(n^{2}-4\right)$ is divisible by 360 whenever $\mathrm{n}$ is a natural number.

### 6 (A Theorem Mentioned in Class)
Prove that for any integer $a$ and $b,(a, b)[a, b]=|a b|$.

### 7 (TBO66)
Prove that if $a, b, c$ are all odd then the quadratic equation $a^{2}+b x+c=0$ cannot have rational roots.

### 8 (TBO136)
Let $a$ be the integer consisting of $\mathrm{m}$ digit 1 's. Let $b$ be the integer consisting of one digit 1 at the start, one digit 5 at the end and with $m-1$ digit 0 's in between.

Show that $a b+1$ is a perfect square and find its square root.

### 9
Let $a$ be a positive integer and suppose that in its decimal expansion it has 7 digits: $a=a_{0}+10 a_{1}+\cdots+1000000 a_{6}$. Show that $a$ is divisible by 7 if and only if $a_{0}+3 a_{1}+2 a_{2}-a_{3}-3 a_{4}-2 a_{5}+a_{6}$ is divisible by 7 .

### 10
Show that if $x$ is an integer then $x^{10} \in\{-1,0,1\}(\bmod 25)$.
