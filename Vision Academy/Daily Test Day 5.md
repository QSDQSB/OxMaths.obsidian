# Daily Test Day 5
1. A traditional fair die is thrown twice. What is the probability that:
(a) a six turns up exactly once?
(b) both numbers are odd?
(c) the sum of the scores is 4 ?
(d) the sum of the scores is divisible by 3 ?
2. A fair coin is thrown repeatedly. What is the probability that on the $n$th throw:
(a) a head appears for the first time?
(b) the numbers of heads and tails to date are equal?
(c) exactly two heads have appeared altogether to date?
(d) at least two heads have appeared to date?

3. Birthdays. At a lecture, there a $m$ students born on independent days in Year $2007$.
(a) With $2 \leq m \leq 365$, show that the probability that at least two of them share a birthday is $p=1-(365) ! /\left\{(365-m) ! 365^{m}\right\}$.
(b) With $2 \leq m \leq 366$, find the probability $p_{1}$ that exactly one pair of individuals share a birthday, with no others sharing.
(c)(optional) Suppose $m$ students are born on independent random days on the planet Magrathea, whose year has $M \gg m$ days. Show that the probability $p_{0}$ that no two students share a birthday is approximately $\left.\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} m(m-1) / M\right)\right)$ for large $M$.

4. Lottery. You choose $r$ of the first $n$ positive integers, and a lottery chooses a random subset $L$ of the same size. What is the probability that:
(a) L includes no consecutive integers?
(b) L includes exactly one pair of consecutive integers?
(c) the numbers in $L$ are drawn in increasing order?
(d) your choice of numbers is the same as $L$ ?
(e) there are exactly $k$ of your numbers matching members of $L$ ?

5. Nine points are randomly placed on a unit isosceles right triangle shown below. Show that three of these points form a triangle whose area is $1 / 8$ square unit or less. (We allow triangles with zero area, in which case the three points lie on a line.)

6. In how many ways can $2 \mathrm{n}$ opponents be paired in the first round of a tennis competition? You can first try to deduce a recurrence relation, then try to solve a general formula.
