# Daily Test Day 4
1. Let $m, n$ be natural numbers. Find the coefficient of $x^{2} y^{3}$ in the expansions of
$$
(2+3 x+5 y)^{m}, \quad(1+x)^{m}(1+y)^{n}, \quad\left(x+y^{2}\right)^{m}\left(y+x^{2}\right)^{n}, \quad(1+x y)^{m}(x+y)^{n}
$$
2. Let $a>0$ and $n$ be a positive integer. The coefficients $c_{k}$ are defined by the identity $(1+a x)^{n}=$ $\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_{k} x^{n}$. Show that $c_{0}<c_{1}<\cdots<c_{n-1}<c_{n}$ ***if and only if*** $n<a$. 

3. *Heron's formula* for the area $A$ of a triangle with sides $a, b$ and $c$, states that
$$
\begin{array}{c}
A^{2}=s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \quad \text { where } \\
s=\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)
\end{array}
$$
Deduce that a triangle of a given perimeter has **greatest** area when it is equilateral.

4. Let $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ be positive reals with $x_{1} x_{2} \times \cdots \times x_{n}=1$. Show that
$$
\left(1+x_{1}\right)\left(1+x_{2}\right) \times \cdots \times\left(1+x_{n}\right) \geqslant 2^{n}
$$
```ad-hint
It might be useful to recall that $$x+{1\over x}\geq 2,\quad \forall x>0$$

5. Mary tosses two coins and John tosses one coin. What is the probability that Mary gets more heads than John? Answer the same question if Mary tosses three coins and John tosses two. Make a conjecture for the probability when Mary tosses $n+1$ and John tosses $n$. Can you prove your conjecture?
