Use sandwiching arguments to prove that, for each of the following choices of $a_{n}$, the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ converges to 0 :
(i) $\frac{n+1}{n^{2}+n+1}$,
(ii) $2^{-n} \cos \left(n^{2}\right)$
(iii) $\sin \frac{1}{n}$,
(iv) $\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2^{n}} & \text { if } n \text { is prime, } \\ -\frac{1}{3^{n}} & \text { otherwise. }\end{array}\right.$

### 2
Let $r>0$. Let $a_{n}=\frac{r^{n}}{n !}$.
(a) By considering $\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}$ show that the tail $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant N}$ is monotonic decreasing if $N$ is sufficiently large. [You should specify a suitable value of N.]
(b) Show that $\left(a_{n}\right)$ converges to a limit $L$ and find the value of $L$.

### 3
Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be a sequence such that the subsequences $\left(a_{2 n}\right)$ and $\left(a_{2 n+1}\right)$ both converge to a real number $L$. Show that $\left(a_{n}\right)$ also converges to $L$.

where $a>1$

## MAT Q5 Type
### 5
Oxwords are sequences of letters $a$ and $b$ that are constructed according to the following rules:
- I. The sequence consisting of no letters is an Oxword.
- II. If $W$ is an Oxword, then the sequence beginning with $a$, followed by $W$ and then $b$, written $a W b$, is an Oxword.
- III. If $U$ and $V$ are Oxwords, then the sequence $U$ followed by $V$, written $U V$, is an Oxword.

All Oxwords are constructed using these rules. The length of an Oxword is the number of letters that occur in it. For example $a a b b$ and $a b a b$ are Oxwords of length $4 .$

(i) Show that every Oxword has an even length.
(ii) List all Oxwords of length $6 .$
(iii) Is the number of occurrences of $a$ in an Oxword necessarily equal to the number of occurrences of $b$ ?
(iv) Show that the Oxwords of length $2 n$ are precisely those words $W$ which use $n$ as and $n b$ such that, for any $i$, the first $i$ letters of $W$ contain at least as many $a \mathrm{~s}$ as $b \mathrm{~s}$.
(v) Show that every Oxword (of positive length) can be written uniquely in the form $a X b Y$ where $X, Y$ are Oxwords.
(vi) For $n \geqslant 0$, let $C_{n}$ be the number of Oxwords of length $2 n$. Show that
$$
C_{n+1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{i} C_{n-i}
$$
