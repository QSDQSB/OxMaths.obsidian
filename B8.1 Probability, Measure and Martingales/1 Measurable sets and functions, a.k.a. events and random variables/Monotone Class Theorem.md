title: Monotone Class Theorem
Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a class of bounded functions from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the following conditions:
(i) $\mathscr{H}$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$,
(ii) the constant function 1 is in $\mathscr{H}$,
(iii) if $\left(f_n\right)_{n \geqslant 1} \subseteq \mathscr{H}$ such that $f_n \nearrow f$ for a bounded function $f$, then $f \in \mathscr{H}$.
If $\mathscr{C} \subseteq \mathscr{H}$ is stable under pointwise multiplication then $\mathscr{H}$ contains all bounded $\sigma(\mathscr{C})$-measurable functions.
