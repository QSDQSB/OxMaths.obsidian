> [!theorem] CarathÃ©odory Extension Theorem
> Let $\Omega$ be a set and $\mathscr{A}$ an algebra on $\Omega$, and let $\mathscr{F}=\sigma(\mathscr{A})$. Let $\mu_0: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ be a countably additive set function. Then there exists a measure $\mu$ on $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ such that $\mu=\mu_0$ on $\mathscr{A}$.
