title: Filtration
A filtration on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is a sequence $\left(\mathscr{F}_n\right)_{n \geqslant 0}$ of $\sigma$-algebras $\mathscr{F}_n \subseteq \mathscr{F}$ such that for all $n, \mathscr{F}_n \subseteq \mathscr{F}_{n+1}$.

We then call $\left(\Omega, \mathscr{F},\left(\mathscr{F}_n\right)_{n \geqslant 0}, \mathbb{P}\right)$ a filtered probability space.

> Usually $n$ is interpreted as time and $\mathscr{F}_n$ represents our knowledge accumulated by time $n$.
