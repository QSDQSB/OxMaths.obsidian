## Definion
The *efficiency* of an unbiased [[Estimate|estimator]] $T$ of $g(\theta)$ is the ratio of its variance and of the [[Cramer-Rao Lower Bound|CRLB]], that is
$$
e(T, \theta)=\frac{\left[g^{\prime}(\theta)\right]^2}{I_X(\theta) \operatorname{Var}_\theta T} .
$$
An **unbiased** estimator which attains the [[Cramer-Rao Lower Bound|CRLB]] is called [[Efficient]].
