## Definition
For a distribution $P$ with density $f$, the [[Support]] of $\mathcal{P}$, equivalently of $f$, is defined as the set
$$
\operatorname{supp}(\mathcal{P})=\{x: f(x)>0\}
$$
### Corollary 1.4
In an [[Exponential Family]] $\mathcal{P}=\{f(x ; \theta), \theta \in \Theta\}$ the [[Support]] of $f(x ; \theta)$ does not depend on $\theta$. We will write $\mathcal{A}$ for the common support of the $f(x ; \theta)$.
