## Time Derivative
#Dynamics 
The **time derivative** of $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}(t)$, as would be measured by an observer co-rotating with the frame $\mathcal{S}$, is
$$
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)_{\mathcal{S}} \equiv \dot{r}_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1}+\dot{r}_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2}+\dot{r}_{3} \mathbf{e}_{3}.
$$
That is, we differentiate the components of $\mathbf{r}$ in the orthonormal basis $\left\{\mathbf{e}_{i}\right\}$ for $\mathcal{S}$.
One should always clarify the meaning of "$\dot{\bf{r}}$' when there are two general reference frames being used. We will **always** mean the time derivative in the inertial reference frame $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ and hence we have shown:
