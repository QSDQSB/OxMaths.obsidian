## Rest Frame
#Dynamics 
### Definition
The [[rest frame]] $\mathcal{S}$ of the [[rigid body]] is a [[reference frame]], with origin $O$, with respect to which the $\mathbf{r}_{I}$ are fixed (at rest), i.e.
$$
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}_{I}}{\mathrm{~d} t}\right)_{\mathcal{S}}=\mathbf{0} \quad \text { for all } \quad I=1, \ldots, N .
$$

>The existence of [[rest frame]] is really equivalent to what we mean by a rigid body in the first place. Provided the matter distribution is not all along a line, *the [[rest frame]] is defined uniquely by the body, up to **a constant rotation of its axes and a translation of the origin by a constant vector** (relative to $\mathcal{S})$.*

As we already mentioned, a natural choice for $O$ is the [[centre of mass]] $G$ of the body. This means that $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{R}_{G}$.

With $\mathbf{R}_{I}=\mathbf{R}_{G}+\mathbf{r}_{I}$ the position vectors of the particles relative to the inertial frame origin, so that $\mathbf{r}_{I} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}_{I}$ in the definition of the centre of mass, we have
$$
\mathbf{R}_{G}=\frac{1}{M} \sum_{I=1}^{N} m_{I} \mathbf{R}_{I}=\frac{1}{M} \sum_{I=1}^{N} m_{I}\left(\mathbf{R}_{G}+\mathbf{r}_{I}\right)=\mathbf{R}_{G}+\frac{1}{M} \sum_{I=1}^{N} m_{I} \mathbf{r}_{I}
$$
Hence
$$
\sum_{I=1}^{N} m_{I} \mathbf{r}_{I}=\mathbf{0}
$$
