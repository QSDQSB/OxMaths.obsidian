## Work Done
#Dynamics 
### Definition
The work done $W$ by the force in moving the particle from $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$ is
$$
W=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} F(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$
Suppose the particle starts at position $x_{1}$ at time $t_{1},$ and finishes at $x_{2}$ at time $t_{2}$ Then combining the definition of work done with $\mathrm{d} V / \mathrm{d} x=-F(x)$ immediately gives
$$
W=-V\left(x_{2}\left(t_{2}\right)\right)+V\left(x_{1}\left(t_{1}\right)\right)
$$
As $T+V$ is constant the change in $V$ is minus the change in $T$ for the particle trajectory and hence we have the [[Work-Energy Relation]].
