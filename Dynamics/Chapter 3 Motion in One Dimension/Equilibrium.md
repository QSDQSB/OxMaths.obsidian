## Equilibrium
#Dynamics 
### Definition
An equilibrium configuration is a solution to Newton's second law (3.1) with $x=x_{e}=$ constant. Since this implies $\ddot{x}=0$ for all time $t,$ Newton's second law implies that $F\left(x_{e}\right)=0,$ and there is no net force acting on the particle.

When there is a potential with $F=-\mathrm{d} V / \mathrm{d} x=-V^{\prime}$ then the equilibrium point $x_{e}$ is a critical point of the potential $V(x)$, with $V^{\prime}\left(x_{e}\right)=0$.

### Motion near an equilibrium point $x=x_e$
Expanding Newton's second law around $x=x_e$, assuming $F(x)$ is suitably smooth and using $F\left(x_{e}\right)=0$ yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
m \ddot{x}&= F(x)=F\left(x_{e}\right)+\left(x-x_{e}\right) F^{\prime}\left(x_{e}\right)+O\left(\left(x-x_{e}\right)^{2}\right) \qquad \color{gray}\textbf{(3.14)}
\\
&=\left(x-x_{e}\right) F^{\prime}\left(x_{e}\right)+O\left(\left(x-x_{e}\right)^{2}\right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $O\left(\left(x-x_{e}\right)^{2}\right)$ means higher order terms, which are not larger than $$\text { Constant }\times\left(x-x_{e}\right)^{2}$$
for $x$ sufficiently close to $x_{e}$.
