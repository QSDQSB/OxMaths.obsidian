## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
#Dynamics 
The gravitational force on a point particle at position $\mathbf{r}_{1}$ due to a point particle at position $\mathbf{r}_{2}$ is given by
$$
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_{12}=-G_{N} \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|^{2}} \frac{\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right)}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|}=-G_{N} \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}
\quad\color{yellow}\text{(6.5)}
$$
Here $m_{1}, m_{2}$ are the (gravitational) masses of the two particles, we have defined the unit vector $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}=\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right)/\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|,$ $G_{N}\simeq6.67\times10^{-11} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~kg}^{-2}$ is  [[Newton's gravitational constant]].
### Note
- We have $\mathbf{F}_{12}=-\mathbf{F}_{21}$. This is [[Newton's third law]].
- If say particle 2 has much more mass, so that $m_{2} \gg m_{1}$, then particle 2 's trajectory can be approximated as essentially stationary.
- We use this assumption regularly. We have already implicitly assumed the Earth is not moved by a projectile and, later, we will also assume the Sun is not moved by the Earth.
- Placing the heavy mass at the origin, so that $\mathbf{r}_{2}=\mathbf{0}$ and with the relabelling $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{1}, m_{2}=M, m_{1}=m$ Eqn (6.5) collapses to the respective force and potential energy
$$
\mathbf{F}=-\frac{\kappa}{r^{2}} \mathbf{e}_{r}, \quad V(r)=-\frac{\kappa}{r}
$$
with $\kappa=G_{N} m M,$ where for planetary examples $M$ is usually the mass of the Sun.
- Energy is conserved as the force is conservative.
- We exclude $r=0$ from our considerations.
