## Inertial Reference Frame
#Dynamics 
### Definition
An inertial reference frame is a frame that is not undergoing acceleration.
### Transformations of an inertial reference frame
- spatial translations, $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x},$ where $\mathbf{x}$ is a constant vector, 
- constant rotations, $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}=\mathcal{R} \mathbf{r},$ where $\mathcal{R}$ is a constant $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix, 
- Galilean boosts, $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{u} t,$ where $\mathbf{u}$ is a constant velocity.

Any combination of the above transformations thus maps an [[Inertial Reference Frame]] to another inertial frame, generating the [[Galilean transformation group]].
Physics is invariant under Galilean transformations: The laws of motion are the same in any inertial frame. This is know as [[Galileo's principle of relativity]].
