## Newton's Second Law
#Dynamics 
### Definition 
Newton's second law states that
In an inertial [[Reference Frame]] the dynamics of a point particle is such that the rate of change of linear momentum is equal to the net force acting on particle:
$$
\mathbf{F}=\dot{\mathbf{p}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}(m \mathbf{v})
$$
Given constant particle mass, this reduces to
$$
\mathbf{F}=m \mathbf{a}=m \ddot{\mathbf{r}}
$$
