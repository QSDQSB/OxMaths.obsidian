## Closed System
#Dynamics 
### Definition
A **closed system** is one in which all forces are internal, acting between the constituents of the system. That is, $\mathbf{F}_{I}^{\mathrm{ext}}=\mathbf{0}, I=1, \ldots, N$.

>For a closed system
>- the total momentum is conserved, $\dot{\mathbf{P}}=\mathbf{0}$. 
>- the centre of mass moves with constant velocity $\dot{\mathbf{R}}_{G}=\text{constant}$. 

Without loss, we may then take the centre of mass to be $\mathbf{R}_{G}=\mathbf{0}$, the origin of our [[inertial reference frame]].
