## Central Force
#Dynamics 
### Definition
A force that is always directed along the line joining a particle to a fixed position in an inertial frame is called a central force.

Without loss, choose this point as the origin of the frame and hence
$$
\mathbf{F} \propto \mathbf{r}
$$
where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector of the particle, measured from the origin $O$.
The importance of central forces is that they always lead to an associated **[conserved](Conservative%20Force) vector quantity**.
### Definition: Angular Momentum
The [[Angular Momentum]] $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{L}_{P}$ of a particle about a point $P$ in an inertial frame is the moment of linear momentum $\mathbf{p}=m \dot{\mathbf{r}}$ about $P$. That is,
$$
\mathbf{L}_{P} \equiv(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}) \wedge \mathbf{p}=(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}) \wedge m \dot{\mathbf{r}}
$$
Here $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector of the point $P,$ while $\mathbf{r}$ is the position of the particle (both measured from the origin $O)$.

### Definition: Torque
The [[torque]] $\boldsymbol{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{P}$ of a force $\mathbf{F}$, about a point $P$ with position vector $\mathbf{x}$, acting on a particle with position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is
$$
\tau_{P} \equiv(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}) \wedge \mathbf{F}.
