1. Let $\phi, \psi:[-6,6] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined by
$$
\phi=3 \mathbf{1}_{[-2,2]}-\mathbf{1}_{(0,4)}+\mathbf{1}_{[4,5)}, \psi=\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}+\mathbf{1}_{[1,5)}
$$
Here, $\mathbf{1}_{X}$ means the function taking the value 1 on $X$ and 0 elsewhere.
(i) Sketch the graphs of $\phi$ and $\psi$;
(ii) Write down a partition $\mathcal{P}$ to which $\phi$ is adapted, and hence express $\phi$ as a linear combination of indicator functions of disjoint bounded intervals;
(iii) Evaluate $I(\phi)$;
(iv) Find a partition $\mathcal{P}$ to which both $\phi$ and $\psi$ are adapted. Express the step functions
$$
|\phi|, \phi^{3}, \phi-\psi, \max (\phi, \psi)
$$
as linear combinations of indicator functions of bounded intervals.
2. Suppose that $\phi$ is a step function. Show that $|\phi|$ is also a step function and that
$$
|I(\phi)| \leqslant I(|\phi|) .
$$
If $|\phi|$ is a step function, is $\phi$ a step function? Justify your answer.
3. Fix real numbers $a, b$ with $a<b .$ Denote by $\mathscr{L}_{\text {step }}$ be the set of all functions which are step functions on $[a, b] .$ Which of the following statements are true?
(i) $\mathscr{L}_{\text {step }}$ is the linear span of all indicator functions $\mathbf{1}_{(c, d)}$ of bounded open intervals, restricted to $[a, b]$ (here and below we do not assume that $a \leqslant c \leqslant d \leqslant b)$
(ii) $\mathscr{L}_{\text {step }}$ is the linear span of all indicator functions $\mathbf{1}_{[c, d]}$ of bounded closed intervals, restricted to $[a, b]$;
(iii) $\mathscr{L}_{\text {step }}$ is the linear span of all indicator functions $\mathbf{1}_{(c, d]}$ of bounded lefthalf-open intervals, restricted to $[a, b]$
(iv) $\mathscr{L}_{\text {step }}$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.
4. Prove that $\int_{0}^{b} x^{2}=b^{3} / 3$.
5. Let $S=\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \ldots\right\}$. Define a function $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=1$ if
$x \in S$ and $f(x)=0$ otherwise. Show that $f$ is Riemann integrable and that its integral is zero.
6. *Suppose that $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an integrable function such that $f(x)>0$ for all $x \in[0,1] .$ Is it true that $\int_{0}^{1} f>0$ ? ^e3626b
