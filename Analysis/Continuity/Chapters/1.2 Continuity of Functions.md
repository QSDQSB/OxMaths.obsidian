## 1.2 Continuity of Functions
#Analysis 
### Definition 1.2.1 
Let $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C})$, where $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$ ), and $p \in E$  (so p belongs to the domain of $f$). If for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is $\delta>0$, such that for every $x \in E$ with $|x-p|<\delta$ we have
$$|f(x)-f(p)|<\varepsilon.$$
then we say that $f$ is [[continuous]] at $p$.
>According to definition, $f$ is [[continuous]] at any isolated point of $E$. If $p$ is a [[Complex Analysis and Metric Spaces/Chapter 5 Interiors, closures, limit points/Limit Point|limit point]] of $E,$ then $f$ is [[continuous]] at $p$, if and only if
>1. $p$ belongs to the domain of $f$, i.e. $f(p)$ is well-defined,
>2. $\lim _{x \to p} f(x)$ exists,
>3. and $\lim _{x \to p} f(x)$ equals the value of $f$ at $p$.

### Example 1.2.2
Let $$g(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}|x|^{\alpha} \sin \frac{1}{x} & \text { if } x \neq 0 \\ 0 & \text { if } x=0\end{array}\right.$$
Then g is [[continuous]] at $x=0$.

### Example 1.2.3
Let $f:(0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by $$f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}{1\over q} & \text { if } x={p\over q} \text { and } (p,q)=1,\\ 
0 & \text { if x is irrational.}\end{array}\right.$$
Then $f$ is [[continuous]] at irrationals of (0,1], and is not [[continuous]] at rationals.
#### Proof
Suppose that $x_0\in(0,1)$ is irrational, so by definition of $f$, $f(x_0)=0$,  hence
$$
|f(x)-f(x_0)|=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \text { if } x \text { is irrational } \\
\frac{1}{q} & \text { if } x=\frac{p}{q} \text { and }(p, q)=1
\end{array}\right.
$$
For every $\varepsilon>0,$ there are only finite many pairs of positive integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p \leq q$ and $q \leq \frac{1}{\varepsilon},$ so that
$$
\delta \equiv \min \left\{\left|x_{0}-\frac{p}{q}\right|: p \leq q \text { and } q \leq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right\}>0
$$
If $\left|x-x_{0}\right|<\delta,$ then $x$ is either irrational and $f(x)=0,$ or $x$ is rational but $0 \leq f(x)<\varepsilon,$ so that
$$
|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\varepsilon
$$
By definition, this shows that $f$ is [[continuous]] at irrational number $x_0$. If $x_0=\frac{p}{q} \in(0,1]$ is rational, then, for $\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2q}>0$ and for whatever how small $\delta>0,$ there is an irrational number $\tilde{x} \in(0,1]$ such that $|\tilde{x}-\frac{p}{q}|<\delta$ (Here we use the fact that rational numbers are [[dense]] in $\mathbb{R}$ proved in Analysis I in MT), so that $$|f(\tilde{x})-f(x_0)|=\frac{1}{q}>\varepsilon.$$

$f$ is not [[continuous]] at rational numbers.

### Proposition 1.2.4
If $f$ and $g$ are [[continuous]] at p, so are $f\pm g$; $fg$ and ${f\over g}$ (provided $g(p)\neq=0$).
*(Definition + AOL).*

### Example 1.2.5: Polynomials are [[continuous]].

### Theorem 1.2.6: Composition of two [[continuous]] functions is [[continuous]]
If $f:E\to\mathbb{C}$ and $g:f(E)\to\mathbb{C}$, and $h:E\to\mathbb{C}$ is the composition function of $g$ and $f$ defined by $$h(x)=(g \circ f)(x) \equiv g(f(x)) \quad \text { for } x \in E.$$ If $f$ is [[continuous]] at $p \in E$ and $g$ is [[continuous]] at $f(p)$, then $h$ is [[continuous]] at $p$.
#### Proof
For any $\varepsilon>0$, since $g$ is [[continuous]] at $f(p)$, there is $\delta_1>0$ such that for any $y \in f(E)$ with $|y-f(p)|<\delta_1$ we have$$|g(y)-g(f(p))|<\varepsilon,$$so that $\forall x\in E$ such that $|f(x)-f(p)|<\delta_1,$ then$$|g(f(x))-g(f(p))|<\varepsilon.$$
Since $f$ is [[continuous]] at $p$, there is $\delta>0$,  $\forall x\in E$ such that $|x-p|<\delta$, we have $$|f(x)-f(p)|<\delta_1.$$
Therefore$$|g(f(x)-g(f(p))|<\varepsilon$$for any $x\in E$ such that $|x-p|<\delta$. So $h$ is [[continuous]] at $p$.
#### Remark
We say $f$ is right [[continuous]] (resp. left) if $f(p+)=f(p)$ (resp. $f(p-)=f(p)$). According to the definition, $f$ is [[continuous]] at $p\in(a,b)$ if and only if $f(p+)=f(p-)=f(p)$.
