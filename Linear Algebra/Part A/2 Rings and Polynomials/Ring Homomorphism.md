## Ring Homomorphism
#LA 
### Definition
A $\operatorname{map} \phi: R \rightarrow S$ between two rings is a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] if for all $r, r^{\prime} \in R$ :
$$
\phi\left(r+r^{\prime}\right)=\phi(r)+\phi\left(r^{\prime}\right) \text { and } \phi\left(r r^{\prime}\right)=\phi(r) \phi\left(r^{\prime}\right)
$$
A bijective [[ring homomorphism]] is called a [[ring isomorphism]].
