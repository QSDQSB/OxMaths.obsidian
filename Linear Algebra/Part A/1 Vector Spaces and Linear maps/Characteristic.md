## Characteristic
#LA 
### Definition
The smallest integer $p$ such that $$1+1+\cdots+1(p \text { times })=0$$ is called the [[Linear Algebra/Part A/1 Vector Spaces and Linear maps/Characteristic]] of $\mathbb{F}$. If no such $p$ exists, the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$ is defined to be zero.

>If such a $p$ exists, it is necessarily prime.

```ad-example
Characteristic $0: \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Q}[i], \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$.
Characteristic $p: \mathbb{F}_{p}=\{0,1, \cdots, p-1\}$ with arithmetic modulo $p$.
