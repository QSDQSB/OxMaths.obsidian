## Bounded
#ComplexAnalysis 

### Definition
Let $X$ be a [[metric space]], and let $Y \subseteq X .$ Then we say that $Y$ is [[bounded]] if $Y$ is contained in some [[open ball]].

### Lemma 1.6.3
Let $X$ be a metric space and let $Y \subseteq X$. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) $Y$ is [[bounded]];
(ii) $Y$ is contained in some [[closed ball]];
(iii) The set $\left\{d\left(y_{1}, y_{2}\right): y_{1}, y_{2} \in Y\right\}$ is a [[bounded]] subset of $\mathbf{R}$.
