## Theorem 7.17.
Suppose that $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function on an open subset $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. If for any closed path $\gamma:[a, b] \rightarrow U$ we have $\int_{\gamma} f(z) d z=0$, then $f$ is [[holomorphic]].

### Proof
By [[Complex Fundamental Theorem of Calculus#Theorem 5.22]] we know that $f$ has a [[primitive]] $F: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. But then $F$ is [[holomorphic]] on $U$ and so infinitely [[Complex Differentiable|differentiable]] on $U$, thus in particular $f=F^{\prime}$ is also [[holomorphic]].
