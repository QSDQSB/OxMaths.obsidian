### Definition
If $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a function on an [[open]] subset $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$, then we say that $f$ is [[analytic]] on $U$ if for every $z_{0} \in U$ there is an $r>0$ with $B\left(z_{0}, r\right) \subseteq U$ such that there is a power series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{k}$ with [[radius of convergence]] at least $r$ and $f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{k}$. An [[analytic]] function is [[holomorphic]], as any power series is (infinitely) [[complex differentiable]].
