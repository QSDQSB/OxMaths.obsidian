## Closed
#ComplexAnalysis 

### Definition
If $X$ is a [[metric space]], then a subset $F \subseteq X$ is said to be a [[closed]] subset of $X$ if and only if its *complement* $F^{c}=X \backslash F$ is an [[open]] subset.

```ad-example
Singleton sets are closed.
```

### Lemma 4.2.2
Let $X$ be a metric space and let $\left\{F_{i}: i \in I\right\}$ be a collection of closed subsets.
(i) The subsets $X$ and $\emptyset$ are closed.
(ii) The intersection $\bigcap_{i \in I} F_{i}$ is a closed subset.
(iii) If $I$ is finite then $\bigcup_{i \in I} F_{i}$ is closed.
