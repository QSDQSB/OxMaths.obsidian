## Rate of Convergence
#FSPDE 

- The smoother $f$, i.e. the more [[Continuous]] derivatives it has, the faster the convergence of the Fourier series for $f$.

- If the first jump discontinuity is in the $p^{\text {th }}$ derivative of $f$, with the convention that $p=0$ if there is a jump discontinuity in $f$, then in general the slowest decaying $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ decay like $1 / n^{p+1}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
- More specifically, if the first jump discontinuity is in the $p^{\text {th }}$ derivative of the even part of $f$, then in general $a_{n}$ decays like $1 / n^{p+1}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$; similarly, if the first jump discontinuity is in the $p^{\text {th }}$ derivative of the odd part of $f$, then in general $b_{n}$ decays like $1 / n^{p+1}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
