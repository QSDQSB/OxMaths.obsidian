## Gibb's Phenomenon
#FSPDE #TODO 
> [[Gibb's Phenomenon]] is the persistent overshoot near a jump discontinuity.

As the number of terms in the partial sum tends to infinity,
- the **width** of the overshoot region tends to zero by the [[Fourier Convergence Theorem]].
- the total height of the overshoot region approaches $\gamma|f(x_+)-f(x_-)|$, where $$\gamma = {1\over\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} {\sin  x\over x} \mathrm{d} x=1.18$$, i.e. approximately a 9% overshoot.
