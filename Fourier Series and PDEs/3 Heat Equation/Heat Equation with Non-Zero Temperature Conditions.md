## Non-Zero Temperature Conditions
#FSPDE 

```ad-question
Consider the heat equation
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\kappa \frac{\partial^{2} T}{\partial x^{2}} \text { for } 0<x<L, t>0
$$
with conditions
$$
T(0,t)=T_1,\quad T(L,t)=T_2, \quad T(x,0)=f(x)
$$

>The problem here is that **separation of variables will no longer work** on this problem because the boundary conditions are no longer *homogeneous*. Recall that separation of variables will only work if both the partial differential equation and the boundary conditions are linear and homogeneous. So, weâ€™re going to need to deal with the boundary conditions in some way before we actually try and solve this.

### Equilibrium Temperature
We should expect that as $t\to\infty$, $T(x)=T_E(x)$ where $T_E(x)$ is called the `equilibrium temperature`. It should satisfy the boundary condition and the heat equation. And solving the ODE we can see that $$T_E(x) = T_1 + {T_2-T_1\over L}x$$

$T_E(x)$ satisfies the heat equation (and the conditions), then suppose $T(x,t)$ is the general solution to the heat equation (with conditions), $T(x,t)-T_E(x)$ also satisfies the heat equation, and moreover, a modified condition which becomes a homogeneous case that enables us to apply [[Fourier's Method]].
