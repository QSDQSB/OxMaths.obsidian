## Inhomogeneous Robin Boundary Condition
#FSPDE 

Inhomogeneous [[Robin Boundary Condition]] prescribes a linear combination of the outward normal derivative and temperature at the boundary, e.g.
$$
-\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(0, t)+\alpha(t) T(0, t)=\phi(t), \quad \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(L, t)+\beta(t) T(l, T)=\psi(t) \quad \text { for } t>0
$$
where the functions $\alpha(t), \phi(t), \beta(t)$ and $\psi(t)$ are given.
