## Definition
Let $\left(X, d_{X}\right)$ and $\left(Y, d_{Y}\right)$ be [[Metric Space|metric spaces]]. We say a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is [[Uniformly Continuous]] if for any $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for any $x, y \in X$ with $d_{X}(x, y)<\delta$ we have $d_{Y}(f(x), f(y))<\epsilon$
