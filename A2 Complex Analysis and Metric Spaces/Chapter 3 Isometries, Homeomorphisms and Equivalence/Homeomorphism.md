## Definition
Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a [[Continuous]] function between [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $X$ and $Y$. We say that $f$ is a [[Homeomorphism]] if it is continuous, a bijection, and if its **inverse** $f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$ is also continuous.

```ad-example
The open interval $(-1,1)$ is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to $\mathbf{R}$ : an explicit [[homeomorphism]] is given by $f(x)=x /(1-|x|)$, which has inverse $g(x)=x /(1+$ $|x|$ ). It follows (using translation and scaling maps) that any open interval is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to $\mathbf{R}$.

```ad-example
A coï¬€ee cup (reusable, with a handle) is homeomorphic to a doughnut.
