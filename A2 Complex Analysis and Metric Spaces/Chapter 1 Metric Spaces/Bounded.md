### Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Metric Space]], and let $Y \subseteq X .$ Then we say that $Y$ is [[Bounded]] if $Y$ is contained in some [[Open ball]].

### Lemma 1.6.3
Let $X$ be a metric space and let $Y \subseteq X$. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) $Y$ is [[Bounded]];
(ii) $Y$ is contained in some [[Closed ball]];
(iii) The set $\left\{d\left(y_{1}, y_{2}\right): y_{1}, y_{2} \in Y\right\}$ is a [[Bounded]] subset of $\mathbf{R}$.
