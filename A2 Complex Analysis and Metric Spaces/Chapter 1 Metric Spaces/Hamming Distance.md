#ComplexAnalysis 

Let $X=\{0,1\}^{n}$ (the boolean cube), the set of all strings of $n$ zeroes and ones. Define $d(x, y)$ to be the number of coordinates in which $x$ and $y$ differ.

>In fact, one can if desired see $\{0,1\}^{n}$ as a subset of $\mathbf{R}^{n}$, and in this case $d$ is the restriction of one of the metrics already considered in Example 1.3.2 [[Metric Space#Definition Metric Space]].
