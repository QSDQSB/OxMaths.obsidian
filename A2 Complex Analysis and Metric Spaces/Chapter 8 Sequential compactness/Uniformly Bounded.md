## Definition
Let $X$ be a [[Sequential Compactness|sequentially compact]] metric space. Let $\mathcal{F} \subseteq C(X)$. Then we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is [[Uniformly Bounded]] if it is [[Bounded]] as a subset of $C(X)$ with the $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$ [[Norm]]. That is, there is some $M$ such that $|f(x)| \leqslant M$ for all $x \in X$ and for all $f \in \mathcal{F}$.
