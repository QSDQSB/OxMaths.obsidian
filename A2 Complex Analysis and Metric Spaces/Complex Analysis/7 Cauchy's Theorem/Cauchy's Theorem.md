title: Cauchy's Theorem on a Simply Connected Domain
Let $f$ be [[holomorphic]] on a [[Simply-Connected|simply connected]] domain $U$ and let $\gamma$ be a closed path in $U$. Then
$$
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \mathrm{d} z=0 .
$$
```
### Proof
$\gamma$ is [[Homotopic]] to a *constant path* $\Gamma$ and so by the [[Deformation Theorem]]
$$
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \mathrm{d} z=\int_{\Gamma} f(z) \mathrm{d} z=0 .
$$
