title: Deformation Theorem
Let $f$ be [[holomorphic]] on a domain $U$ and let $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ be [[homotopic]] closed paths in $U$. Then
$$
\int_{\gamma_{1}} f(z) \mathrm{d} z=\int_{\gamma_{2}} f(z) \mathrm{d} z .
$$
```
^theorem

```ad-example
Any $\gamma\left(a_{1}, r_{1}\right)$ and $\gamma\left(a_{2}, r_{2}\right)$ are [[homotopic]] in $\mathbb{C}$.
**Solution** 
We may use
$$
H(\theta, u)=u a_{2}+(1-u) a_{1}+\left(u r_{2}+(1-u) r_{1}\right) e^{2 \pi i \theta}
$$
