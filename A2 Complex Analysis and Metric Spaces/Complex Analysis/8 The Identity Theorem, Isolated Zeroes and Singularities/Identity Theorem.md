## Theorem 8.3.
Let $U$ be a domain and suppose that $f_{1}, f_{2}$ are [[Holomorphic]] functions defined on $U$. Then if $S=\left\{z \in U: f_{1}(z)=f_{2}(z)\right\}$ has a [[A2 Complex Analysis and Metric Spaces/Chapter 5 Interiors, closures, limit points/Limit Point|limit point]] in $U$, we must have $S=U$, that is $f_{1}(z)=f_{2}(z)$ for all $z \in U$.
