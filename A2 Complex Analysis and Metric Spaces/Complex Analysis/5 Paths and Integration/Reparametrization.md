## Definition
Let $\phi:[a, b] \rightarrow[c, d]$ be continuously differentiable with $\phi(a)=c$ and $\phi(b)=d$, and let $\gamma:[c, d] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a $C^{1}$-[[Path]], then setting $\tilde{\gamma}=\gamma \circ \phi$, by [[Path's Chain Rule]] we see that $\tilde{\gamma}:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is again a $C^{1}$-path with the same image as $\gamma$ and we say that $\tilde{\gamma}$ is a [[Reparametrization]] of $\gamma$.
