title: Homotopic
Let $\gamma_{1}:[0,1] \rightarrow U$ and $\gamma_{2}:[0,1] \rightarrow U$ be two closed paths in a domain $U$ We say that $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ are [[homotopic]] if there is a continuous function $H:[0,1]^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that for each $u \in[0,1]$, then $H(\ldots, u):[0,1] \rightarrow U$ is a closed [[path]] in $U$ and for all $t \in[0,1]$,
$$
H(t, 0)=\gamma_{1}(t), \quad H(t, 1)=\gamma_{2}(t) .
