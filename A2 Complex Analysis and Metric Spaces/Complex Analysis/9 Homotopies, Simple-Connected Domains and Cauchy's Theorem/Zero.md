# Zero and Order of f
#ComplexAnalysis 

## Definition
Let $f$ be [[Holomorphic]] on some domain $U$ and let $a \in U$. Let the [[Taylor's Theorem|Taylor series]] of $f$ at $a$ be
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(z-a)^{n} .
$$
We say that a is a ==zero== of $f$ if $f(a)=c_{0}=0$ and the ==order== of the zero to be $N$ where $N$ is the least $n$ such that $c_{n} \neq 0$.
