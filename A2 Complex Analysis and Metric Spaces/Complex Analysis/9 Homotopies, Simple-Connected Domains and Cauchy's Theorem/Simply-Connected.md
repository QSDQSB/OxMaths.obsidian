#ComplexAnalysis 

## Definition
We say that a domain $U$ is simply-connected if every closed curve in $U$ is [[Homotopic]] to a point (i.e. to a constant path).

```ad-example
(open and closed) discs, (open and closed) half-planes, line segments and cut-planes are all [[simply-connected]] domains.

*Punctured* discs, circles and $\mathbb{C} \backslash\{0\}$ are domains which are not [[simply-connected]].
