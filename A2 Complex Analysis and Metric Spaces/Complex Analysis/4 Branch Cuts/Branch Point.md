## Definition: Branch Point
Suppose that $f: U \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{C})$ is a multi-valued function defined on an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$. We say that $z_{0} \in U$ is ***not*** a [[Branch Point]] of $f$ if there is an open disk$^2$ $D \subseteq U$ containing $z_{0}$ such that there is a [[Holomorphic]] [[Branch]] of $f$ defined on $D \backslash\left\{z_{0}\right\}$. We say $z_{0}$ is a [[Branch Point]] otherwise. When $\mathbb{C} \backslash U$ is bounded, we say that $f$ does not have a [[Branch Point]] at $\infty$ if there is a [[Holomorphic]] [[Branch]] of $f$ defined on $\mathbb{C} \backslash B(0, R) \subseteq \bar{U}$ for some $R>0$. Otherwise we say that $\infty$ is a [[Branch Point]] of $f$.
