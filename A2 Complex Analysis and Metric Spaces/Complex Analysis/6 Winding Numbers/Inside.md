## Definition
Let $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a closed [[Path]]. We say that a point $z$ is in the [[Inside]] of $\gamma$ if $z \notin \gamma^{*}$ and $I(\gamma, z) \neq 0$. The previous remark shows that the inside of $\gamma$ is a union of bounded connected components of $\mathbb{C} \backslash \gamma^{*} .(W e$
