## Definition
If $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a function on an [[Open]] subset $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$, then we say that $f$ is [[Analytic]] on $U$ if for every $z_{0} \in U$ there is an $r>0$ with $B\left(z_{0}, r\right) \subseteq U$ such that there is a power series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{k}$ with [[Radius of Convergence]] at least $r$ and $f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k}\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{k}$. An [[Analytic]] function is [[Holomorphic]], as any power series is (infinitely) [[Complex Differentiable]].
