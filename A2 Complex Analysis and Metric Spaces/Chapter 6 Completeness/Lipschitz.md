## Definition
Let $\left(X, d_{X}\right)$ and $\left(Y, d_{Y}\right)$ be metric spaces and suppose that $f: X \rightarrow Y$. We say that $f$ is a [[A2 Complex Analysis and Metric Spaces/Chapter 6 Completeness/Lipschitz|Lipschitz]] map (or is Lipschitz [[Continuous]]) if there is a constant $K \geqslant 0$ such that
$$
d_{Y}(f(x), f(y)) \leqslant K d_{X}(x, y).
$$
