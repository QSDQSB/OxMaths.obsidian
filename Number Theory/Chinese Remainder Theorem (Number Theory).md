```ad-theorem
Suppose that $q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{k}$ are pairwise coprime positive integers (that is, $\left(q_{i}, q_{j}\right)=1$ for all $i \neq j$ ). Suppose that $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}$ are integers. Then there is an integer $x$ such that $x \equiv a_{i}\left(\bmod q_{i}\right)$ for $i=1,2, \ldots, k$.

- Moreover, $x$ is unique $\left(\bmod q_{1} \cdots q_{k}\right)$.
