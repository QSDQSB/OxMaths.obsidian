## Subgroup
#Groups 
### Definition
Let $(G,*)$ be a [[Group]]. We say that a subset $H\subseteq G$ is a [[Subgroup]] if the restriction of $*$ to $H$ makes $H$ into a group. That is,
- $H$ is [[Groups and Group Actions/2 Introduction to Groups/Closed]] under $*$ (if $h_1,h_2\in H$ then $h_1h_2\in H$);
- $H$ has an [[Identity]] ($e_G\in H$);
- $H$ contains [inverses](Inverse.md) (if $h\in H$ then $h^{-1}\in H$).

> We write $H\leq G$ to mean that $\textit{H is a }\textbf{subgroup}\textit{ of G}$.

> No need to check [associativity](Associative.md) for $H$, as $H$ inherits it from $G$.
