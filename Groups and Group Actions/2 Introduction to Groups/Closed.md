## Closed
#Groups 
### Definition
>Let $*$ be a binary operation on a set $S$. Let $T$ be a subset of $S$. We say that $T$ is [[Groups and Group Actions/2 Introduction to Groups/Closed ]] under $*$ if $*: T \times T \rightarrow T$ is a [[Binary Operation]] on $T$.

### Example
>$+$ and $-$ are binary operations on $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ is closed under $+$ but not under $-$.

### Definition:MVC
>We say a curve $\gamma:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is **closed** if $\gamma(a)=\gamma(b)$.
