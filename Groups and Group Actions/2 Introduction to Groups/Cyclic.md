## Cyclic
#Groups 
### Definition
We say that a group $G$ is [[cyclic]] if there is some $g \in G$ such that $G=\left\{g^{n}: n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$.
### Example
$(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is [[cyclic]], **generated** by $1 .$ It is also generated by $-1$.
### Remark
A cyclic group must be **[[Abelian]]**, as $g^{n} g^{m}=g^{n+m}=g^{m+n}=g^{m} g^{n}$.

### Definition: Nth Cyclic Group
For $n \geq 1$, we define the $n^{\text {th }}$ [[cyclic group]] $C_{n}$ to be the set $\left\{e, g, g^{2}, \ldots, g^{n-1}\right\}$, where $g^{n}=e$, and for $0 \leq i, j \leq n-1$ we define
$$
g^{i} * g^{j}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
g^{i+j} & \text { if } i+j<n \\
g^{i+j-n} & \text { if } i+j \geq n
\end{array}\right..
$$

> Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

> Every finite cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ (the group of integers modulo _n_ with the addition operation).

> Every cyclic group of prime order is a simple group which cannot be broken down into smaller groups.

### Theorem 1
> All subgroups of a cyclic group are cyclic. If $G=\langle a\rangle$ is cyclic, then for every divisor $d$ of $|G|$ there exists exactly one subgroup of order $d$ which may be generated by $a^{|G| / d}$

#### Proof
Let $|G|=d n$. Then $1, a^{n}, a^{2 n}, \ldots, a^{(d-1) n}$ are distinct and form a cyclic subgroup $\left\langle a^{n}\right\rangle$ of order $d$. Conversely, let $H=\left\{1, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{d-1}\right.$ be a subgroup of $G$ for some $d$ dividing $G$. Then for all $i, a_{i}=a^{k}$ for some $k$, and since every element has order dividing $|H|, a_{i}^{d}=a^{k d}=1 .$ Thus $k d=|G| m=n d m$ for some $m$, and we have $a_{i}=a^{n m}$ so each $a_{i}$ is in fact a power of $a^{n}$. From above this means it must be one of the $d$ subgroups already described.
