## Equivalence Class
Let $\sim$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on a set $S$. For $a \in S$, we define the [[equivalence class]] of $a$, written $[a]$ or $\bar{a}$, to be the set $\{b \in S: a \sim b\}$. "all the things related to $a$."

#### Example
The equivalence classes for congruence modulo $n$ are
$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{0} &=n \mathbb{Z} \\
\overline{1} &=1+n \mathbb{Z} \\
\overline{2} &=2+n \mathbb{Z} \\
& \vdots \\
\overline{n-1} &=(n-1)+n \mathbb{Z}
\end{aligned}
$$
by the division algorithm, this is all.

>For a permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$, its equivalence class under conjugation in $S_{n}$ is its [[conjugacy class]], which, as we saw, consists precisely of those permutations in $S_{n}$ that have the same cycle type as $\sigma$.

> Equivalence class of $e$ forms a [[Normal Subgroup]].
