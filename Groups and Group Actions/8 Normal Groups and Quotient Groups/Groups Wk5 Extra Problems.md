  #Groups 
  
  
1) Show that if half the elements of a group have order $2$, then the rest of the elements form an Abelian [[normal subgroup]] of odd order.  
  
2) Let $G$ be a finite group of order $p^n$, where $p$ is prime and n is a positive integer.Â  Show that any subgroup of $G$ of index $p$ must be normal.  
  
3) Let $(Q,+)$ be the group of rational numbers under addition.Show that $(Q,+)$ has no proper subgroups of finite [[index]].
