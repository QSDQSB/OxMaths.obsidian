### P1
> A finite group of even [[order]] must contain an element of [[order]] 2.
#### Proof
> Each element in $G$ contains a unique inverse. When $g\in G$ is not its own inverse, we pack them up. That leaves finally the identity $e$, and at least 1 (or any positive odd number greater than 1) element $g_1\not=e$ in G such that $g_1$ is its own inverse, i.e. $g_1^1\not=g_1^2=e$.

### P2
> Is there a group in which no non-identity element is its own inverse?

Consider $C_5$. Every non-identity element has order 4, and hence not its own inverse. #Q 

### P3
> How many ways to complete the following grid so that it is the Cayley table of a group?
$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
* & e & a & b & c \\
\hline 
e & & & & \\
a & & & & \\
b & & & & \\
c & & & &
\end{array}
$$
> Two.

## Main Course
6. (i) Let $G, H$ be groups. Show that $G \times H$ is [[Abelian]] if and only if $G, H$ are both Abelian.
(ii) Show that the map
$$
\phi: \mathbb{C}^{*} \rightarrow(0, \infty) \times S^{1} \quad \text { given by } \quad \phi(z)=(|z|, z /|z|)
$$
is an [[isomorphism]].
(iii) Show that $S^{1}$ is isomorphic to $S O(2)$ but that $S^{1} \times\{\pm 1\}$ is not isomorphic to $O(2)$.
