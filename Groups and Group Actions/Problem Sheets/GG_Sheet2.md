1. Three permutations $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ of $\{1,2, \ldots, 11,12\}$ are given below. In each case express the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles.
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\alpha=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
12 & 6 & 5 & 7 & 4 & 8 & 11 & 2 & 3 & 9 & 10 & 1
\end{array}\right) \\
\beta=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
12 & 11 & 10 & 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right) \\
\gamma=\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 10 & 8 & 12 & 7 & 11
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}
$$
What is the order of each [[permutation]]? Which are even and which are odd permutations? Write $\alpha^{2}, \alpha \beta, \gamma^{-1}$ as products of disjoint cycles.
2. There are five different types of [[cycle]] decomposition of $\{1,2,3,4\}:$ the identity permutation, 2-cycles (e.g. (12)), 3-cycles (e.g. (123)), 4-cycles (e.g. (1234)) and double transpositions (e.g. $(12)(34))$. How many are there of each type in $S_{4}$ ? (You should have $4 !=24$ permutations in all.)
What types of cycle decomposition arise among even permutations of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and how many are there of each type? (Note that $\left|A_{5}\right|=60 .$ )
3. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $k \in\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Show that
$$
\sigma^{-1}(123 \ldots k) \sigma=(1 \sigma 2 \sigma \ldots k \sigma)
$$
The permutations $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in S_{5}$ are given by
$$
\alpha=(123)(45), \quad \beta=(1234), \quad \gamma=(23)
$$
Find $\left(\alpha \beta^{5} \gamma^{3} \alpha^{2} \gamma \beta^{3} \alpha^{5}\right)^{3}$.
4. (i) Let $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)$ denote the sign of a permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ (that is, $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)=1$ if $\sigma$ is even and $-1$ if $\sigma$ is odd). Show for $\sigma, \tau \in S_{n}$ that
$$
\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma \tau)=\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \operatorname{sgn}(\tau)
$$
(ii) Show that a permutation with odd order must be even. Does the converse hold?
(iii) The vertices of a regular pentagon are labelled clockwise 1 to 5 . Show that every symmetry of the pentagon corresponds to an even permutation. How will the situation vary if the vertices are now arbitrarily labelled with the numbers 1 to $5 ?$
5. (i) Show that $V_{4}=\{e,(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}$ is an [[Abelian]] group.
(ii) Show that $V_{4}$ is isomorphic to $C_{2} \times C_{2}$.
(iii) How many [isomorphisms](Isomorphism) are there from $V_{4}$ to $C_{2} \times C_{2}$ ?
6. (i) Find a [[permutation]] $\alpha \in S_{7}$ such that $\alpha^{4}=(2143567)$. Is $\alpha$ unique?
(ii) Find all permutations $\alpha \in S_{7}$ such that $\alpha^{3}=(1234)$.
(iii) Find permutations $\alpha, \beta \in S_{5}$ both with order 3 such that $\alpha \beta$ has order 5 .
(iv) Let $n \geqslant 3$. Find permutations $\alpha, \beta \in S_{n}$ both with order 2 such that $\alpha \beta$ has [[order]] $n$.
