## Cycle Type
#Groups 
### Definition
For a given [[permutation]] $\sigma\in S_n$, [[Disjoint#Theorem 9]] shows that the lengths of the cycles of $\sigma$ (written as a product of disjoint cycles) are [[well-defined]]. This is called the **cycle type** of $\sigma$.
> The [[permutation]] $(\text{1 5 3 9)(2 6)(4 7})\in S_9$ has cycle type $4,2,2,1$.

### Proposition 10
Let $\pi \in S_{n}$ be written as $\pi=\sigma_{1} \sigma_{2} \cdots \sigma_{k}$ as a product of [[disjoint]] cycles. For $1 \leq i \leq k$, let $l_{i}$ be the length of $\sigma_{i}$. Then the [[order]] of $\pi$ is $\operatorname{lcm}\left(l_{1}, \ldots, l_{k}\right)$.
