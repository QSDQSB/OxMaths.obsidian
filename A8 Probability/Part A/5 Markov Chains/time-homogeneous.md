#Probability 

## Definition
The [[Markov chain]] is called [[time-homogeneous]] if in addition $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{n+1}=j \mid X_{n}=i\right)$ depends only on $i$ and $j$, ==not on $n$==. In that case we write
$$
p_{i j}=\mathbb{P}\left(X_{n+1}=j \mid X_{n}=i\right)
$$

The quantities $p_{ij}$ are known as the `transition probabilities` of the chain.
