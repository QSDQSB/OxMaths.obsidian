#Probability 
## Definition
If there is a probability mass function $\pi(i), i \in \Omega$ satisfying
$$
\pi(x) P(x, y)=\pi(y) P(y, x) \quad \text { for all } x, y \in \mathcal{X}
\quad\quad(1)
$$
A Markov chain whose stationary distribution $\pi$ and transition probability matrix $P$ satisfy (1) is called [[Reversible Markov Chain|reversible]].

The equations (1) are also called the [[detailed balance equations]].
