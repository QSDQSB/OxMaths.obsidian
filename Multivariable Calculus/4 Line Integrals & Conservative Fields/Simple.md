## Simple
#MVC 
>We say a curve $\gamma:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is **[[simple]]** if $\gamma$ is $1-1$, with the one possible exception that $\gamma(a)=\gamma(b)$ may be true. This means that the curve does not cross itself except possibly by its endpoints meeting.

#Groups 
>In any group $G$, it is the case that $\{e\}$ and $G$ are normal subgroups of $G .$ If these are the only ones then $G$ is said to be [[simple]].
